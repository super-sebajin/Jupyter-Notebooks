    "# Abstract:\n",
    "A stochastic process is a mathematical model of a time-dependent state-system where transitions from one state to another are dictated by a set of probabilities. I will attempt to use a process based on Markov-Chains on the complete bipartite graph of 4 vertices and 4 edges for hamiltonian cycles (or walks) on the graph. However, a Markov-Chain requires the system to be \"memory-less\" of its previous states, as well as permitting loops and multiple directed edges, thus is the reason for this being a \"markov-like\" process. For transition matrices, the matrices commonly used for graph representation will be used. However, the rows of these matrices will have probabilites instead of $1$s, with an invariant that the entries in the rows all sum to $1$:\n",

    "$$\\sum_{j=1}^{n} a_{i,j} = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\mathbf{P}_{j}(X=x) = 1.$$\n",
